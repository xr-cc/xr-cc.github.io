I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Data Science Institute at Brown University, working with Dr. [Sohini Ramachandran](https://webhelper.brown.edu/ramachandran/). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University in 2023, where I was supervised by Dr. [Noah Rosenberg](https://rosenberglab.stanford.edu/index.html).

My research focuses on method development in population genetics, computational biology, and data science. I use computational techniques, such as machine learning, optimization, network analysis, and statistical inference, to develop methods and measures for analyzing complex genetic and genomic data, including population structure, genetic diversity measures, cellular heterogeneity in transcriptomic data, and the genetic architecture of complex traits.
I am also broadly interested in interdisciplinary work that bridges data and computational sciences with the biological sciences and beyond.

*I am on the job market this year; if you know of any suitable openings, please feel free to get in touch.*
