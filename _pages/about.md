Xiran is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Data Science Institute, Brown University, working with Dr. Sohini Ramachandran. Before that, she earned her Ph.D. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University in 2023, where she was supervised by Dr. Noah Rosenberg.
Her research focuses on population genetics, computational biology, and data science. She develops computational methods to tackle challenges in analyzing complex biological data, including investigating population genetic structure, understanding cellular heterogeneity from transcriptomic data, and studying the genetic architecture of complex traits. She is also broadly interested in  interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge computational and biological sciences and beyond.
