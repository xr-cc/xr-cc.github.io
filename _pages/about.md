Xiran is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Data Science Institute, Brown University, working with Dr. Sohini Ramachandran. Before that, she received her Ph.D. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University in 2023, where she was supervised by Dr. Noah Rosenberg.
Her research focuses on population genetics, computational biology, and data science. She develops computational methods to tackle challenges in analyzing complex genetic and genomic datasets, including population genetic structure, cellular heterogeneity in transcriptomic data, and the genetic architecture of complex traits. She is also broadly interested in interdisciplinary work that bridge computational and biological sciences and beyond.
