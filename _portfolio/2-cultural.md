    <p>Cultural evolution is the study of how socially learned behaviors, ideas, technologies, and norms change over time by processes analogous to biological evolution, but operating through social learning rather than genes. I study cultural variation using methods inspired by biological evolution, including the extraction of hierarchical structure in cultural variation and the intergenerational transmission of cultural traits.</p>
