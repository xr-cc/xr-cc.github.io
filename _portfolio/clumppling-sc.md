title: "Clustering alignment to complement and advance single-cell clustering"
excerpt: "I extend the clustering alignment framework to the single-cell analysis pipeline. Specifically, I develop new metrics for feature-level interpretation to identify cluster-informative genes, and provide measures of clustering consistency for comparing results from different clustering models. The alignment-enabled single-cell analysis pipeline streamlines robust clustering results evaluation, straightforward model comparison, and gene selection for downstream analyses. <br/><img src='/images/projects/clumppling-st.png'
