title: "Clustering alignment for population structure analysis"
excerpt: "I work on clustering alignment challenges in population structure analysis. I developed <i>Clumppling</i> to align multiple results and summarize distinct solutions, presenting the inferred population structure across different numbers of clusters (latent ancestries) in a multipartite graph of structure bar plots as well as the alignment patterns between inferred clusters.<br/><img src='/images/projects/clumppling.png'

Check out *KAlignedoscope*, an interactive visualization tool built by *Avery Guo* (undergrad @ Brown) for aligned population structure analysis results [here](https://github.com/ramachandran-lab/KAlignedoscope).

Also see [here](https://github.com/PopGenClustering/popstru-cls-align-vis-workflow) for a tutorial on the comprehensive workflow of performing population structure analysis end-to-end, from raw data preparation to creating publication-quality visualizations, using popular tools like *Structure* or *ADMIXTURE*, as well as *Clumppling* and *KAlignedoscope*.
